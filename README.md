# Advent_of_code_2023
My attempts to solve various challenges in the advent of code 2023.

I will use primarily C#, Java & Rust as these are three languages I want to learn in 2024.

I'll also use JavaScript as a reference to my own knowledge on that language as I have some experience with it, this will however just be a rewrite of solved tasks rather than using JS directly to solve challenges.

## C#
```cs
// C# solutions goes here
```
# JAVA
```java
// Java solutions goes here
```
# RUST
```rs
// Rust solutions goes here
```
# JavaScript
```ts
// JavaScript/TypeScript solutions goes here
```
